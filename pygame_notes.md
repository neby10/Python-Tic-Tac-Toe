## Pygame Reference

#### Install and Import
~~~
pip install pygame

import pygame
~~~

#### Initialize a pygame game, Set up a display, Quit a pygame game
~~~
pygame.init()

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))

pygame.quit()
~~~


#### Draw a rectangle, Draw a line
~~~
pygame.draw.rect(screen, COLOR, pygame.Rect(start_x, start_y, x, y))

pygame.draw.line(screen, BLUE, start_pos, end_pos, line_width)
~~~

#### Displaying text
~~~
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36) # creates a Font object with specified font file (or None for default) and font size of 36 pixels
text_content = "Hello, Pygame!"
text_surface = font.render(text_content, True, "white") # specifies that the text should be rendered as a surface containing text_content using specified font with anti-aliasing (smooth edges) and in white color.
text_rect = text_surface.get_rect() # retrieves a rectangular bounding box for the rendered text surface
text_rect.center = (width // 2, height // 2) # sets the center position of the bounding box to the center of the screen
screen.blit(text_surface, text_rect) # draws the text surface onto the screen at the position specified by text_rect
